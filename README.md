2. [ ] Copy the **parts you need to customize** from the default [theme-dark.toml][theme-dark] or [theme-light.toml][theme-light] as `./flavor.toml`, and change them to meet your preferences.
3. [ ] Find a `.tmTheme` file on GitHub that matches the color of your flavor, copy it and it's license file as `./tmtheme.xml`, and `LICENSE-tmtheme`.
4. [ ] Modify the content and preview image in the README to fit your flavor.

## üé® Installation

<!-- Please replace "username/example" with your repository name. -->

```sh
ya pack -a username/example
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

<!--
Please replace "example" with your flavor name.

If your flavor uses a light color scheme, use "light" instead of "dark" wherever it appears below.
-->

To set it as your dark flavor, change the content of your `theme.toml` to:

```toml
[flavor]
dark = "example"
```

Make sure your `theme.toml` doesn't contain anything other than `[flavor]`, unless you want to override certain styles of this flavor.

See the [Yazi flavor documentation](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/flavors/overview) for more details.
